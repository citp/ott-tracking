## Plots in Figure 5


The following R Markdown files generate the two plots in Figure 5 in the paper. The markdown files take a CSV version of the pickle files (e.g., amazon-data-20190509-133243_tcp_conn.pkl) from our data release as input.

The pickle files can be converted to CSV using files can be generated using the `pickle_to_csv.py` file in this directory.

The `theme_Publication` routine in the Markdown files is borrowed from Koundinya Desiraju's example [here](https://rpubs.com/Koundy/71792).
